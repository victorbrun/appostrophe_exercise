# Data engineering exercise | Appostrophe AB

## Introduction and background

This repo contains code and documentation related to an exercise provided by Appostrophe AB as part of the interview process for a data engineering position.

The scope of the exercise involves collecation, processing and storage of marketing data for the imaginary iOS app BestPhotoEditor. Below follow the aspects which the solution should take into account:
1. The app was recently released on the AppStore and has a single marketing channel; Meta.
2. The marketing team needs to know the advertisement campaigns on Meta are performing. A data analyst will support them on this toppic, but they need to have the raw data available in GoogleBigQuery to carry out their analysis.
3. As of now, the marketing campaigns in Meta are composed of five different campaigns focusing on 5 different regions. There are however plans to increase the number of campaigns and regions. Morover, each of the campaigns have multiple adsets and ads.
4. Multiple metrics are relevant for the data team to analyse, but the main ones are: spend, reach, impressions, clicks, attributed installs, attributed conversions.
5. Above metrics need to be combined with the following dimensions: date, country, campaign (name and id), adset (name and id) and ad.

This exercise involes the following tasks:
1. Draft a project plan starting from the data collection phase and ending with the data being put on GoogleBigQuery, making it readily available for data analysts. The plan ought to detail what software or tools will be used in each step.
2. Write the code needed to gather the required data from the [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/).
3. Explain how above mentioned code can be extended to other apps and their related API, e.g., TikTok and Google Ads.
